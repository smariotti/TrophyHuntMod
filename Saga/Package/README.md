# Valheim Saga

"Saga" is a set of rule changes to speed up progression through the map and the upgrade tree for doing a four hour event!

## Trophy Saga

- Trophies drop 100% of the time until you have one, then drop at vanilla valheim rate (except Deer, which always drops.) This is the same as Trophy Rush
- Combat is set to Normal difficulty
- Resource Rate is set to 2x (you get double all resources picked up, dropped by enemies, or found in chests)
- Death penalty is -30 points
- Relog penalty is -10 points
- Metal Ores "insta-smelt" when you pick them up. If you pick up ore from the ground or out of a chest, it becomes the equivalent metal bar instantly.
- Mining is twice as productive
- Portals allow **all** items through (metals, eggs, etc.)
- Modified Enemy Loot
	- Greylings drop various useful Meadows and Black Forest items, including Finewood
	- Trolls have a 66% chance to drop Megingjord
	- Biome Boss Minions now have a chance to drop Boss Items

	  - Mountains: Drakes have a chance to drop Moder's Tears
	  - Plains: Fuling Shaman and Berserker have a chance to drop Torn Spirit
	  - Mistlands: Seeker Soldiers have a chance to drop Majestic Carapace
	  - Hildir Mini-bosses always drop their Biome's Boss Item
	- Dverger drop a dozen or so pieces of Yggrasil wood when they die
	- Rancid Remains always drops his mace (Iron Mace, non-poisonous)
- Production buildings that take time to process **all** take only seconds
  - Fermenter
  - Beehive
  - Charcoal Kiln
  - Spinning Wheel
  - Windmill
  - Sap Extractor
  - Eitr Refiner (this also **no longer requires Soft Tissue**, just Sap)

- Pickaxes are more productive when mining
- All planted seeds and saplings grow to maturity within 10 seconds (as in previous version)
- All Player Skills are learned at level 10 and then increase normally.
